# simple_mars_rover_with_lidar
here you can see my final project for #gazebo 3D robotics simulator; that is a simple #mars_rover using :

++ a #lidar ( light detection &amp; ranging \ laser radar) and it can see objects as obstacles using it's #lidar

++ it has some joints
  ++ some suspension joints (robot is using suspensions system for it's wheels )
  ++ prismatic_joints
  ++ fixed_joints
  ++ revolute_joints
  
++ using two #meshes for wheels and the cabin of the rover from .stl file

++ also meshes from other models of gazebo models

It's just a simple example for beginner-level gazebo users who want to know how to do it, and I'm glad to share it with you

HAVE FUN ;) AND REMEMBER THAT SKILLS & SCIENCE MUST BE FREE AND OPEN FOR EVERYONE
