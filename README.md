# simple_mars_rover_with_lidar
here you can see my final project for #gazebo &amp; #ros ( #robot_operating_system ) that is a #mars_rover using a #lidar ( light detection &amp; ranging \ laser radar) and it can see objects as obstacles using it's #lidar and it has some joints (&amp; some suspension joints) like #prismatic_joints , #fixed_joints &amp; #revolute_joints , also I'm using two #meshes for wheels and the cabin of the rover from .stl file and also from other models from gazebo models It's just a simple example for beginner level gazebo users and I'm glad to share it with you
